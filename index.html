      <h1>Why Recycle?</h1>
      <div>
        <p>Climate change is one of our generations main problem. As Dr Margaret Chan, a World Health Organization Director said “A healthy environment underpins a healthy population, if countries do not take actions to make environments where people live and work healthy, millions will continue to become ill and die too young.”</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Although we can’t stop large corporations polluting the world, we can do our share in stopping it. Currently, mismanaged waste is adding new problems to an already dire situation. Plastic waste is blocking waterways and causing flooding, which in turn spreads waterborne diseases. When people burn the waste to get rid of it, it releases harmful toxins and causes air pollution. This indirectly led to the 12.6 million people’s death as a result of living or working in an unhealthy environment in just 2012. Furthermore, landfills are among the biggest contributors to soil pollution.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Currently, nine-tenths of all solid waste in the United States does not get recycled. While 75% of America’s waste is recyclable, we only recycle around 30% of it. Think about it, a single recycled plastic bottle saves enough energy to run a 100-watt bulb for 4 hours. It only takes 5 recycled plastic bottles to make enough fiberfill to stuff a ski jacket. It also creates 20% less air pollution and 50% less water pollution than would be created when making a new bottle. Don't think throwing away your plastic bottle will have no effects, just one plastic bottle takes 500 years to fully decompose.</p>

      <h2>What do we do?</h2>
      <p>Attack on Trash is the first step to solving a world-wide devastating problem. As trash continues to build up, spreading over our lands, many people don’t even know which objects are reusable and recyclable, thus leading to even more waste filling up our world. We plan on changing this with our website. With the aim to reduce recyclable waste by connecting people to companies nearby to reuse their recyable parts, Attack on Trash teaches both kids and adults how important recycling is to our planet Earth.</p>

<h3>What do you need to pitch in?</h3>
<p>All you need to have is a willing heart to help save our world from the smoky grasps of pollution and waste piling up our beautiful lands.</p>

<h3>What do you need to do to help?</h3>
<p>Remember that just because something you view as trash doesn't have to be thrown into a dumpster. In fact, _________% of all materials on Earth are indeed reuseable or recyable. Things like mattresses and chairs can be taken apart by specialized companies for their reuseable parts, reducing even more waste that would have been thrown into a dumpster. However, most people don't know what objects has parts that are reuseable or not, and that's where we come on. Attack on Trash has the answers for those questions, allowing you to search up what it is you want to reycle and connecting you to companies specialzied in recycling your waste. </p>

<h2>Don't stall any longer, recycle now!</h2>
